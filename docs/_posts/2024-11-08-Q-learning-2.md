Integrating Lidar data was exciting but tricky. I struggled to understand the format of the Lidar detections provided by SMARTS. After some trial and error, I discovered that the data included the relative positions of detected obstacles. I processed this data into a more usable format for state updates.

Initially, the Lidar data overwhelmed the algorithm due to too much noise. I resolved this by applying a threshold to ignore faraway objects, simplifying the state representation. This step improved the learning process and reduced unnecessary computations.
