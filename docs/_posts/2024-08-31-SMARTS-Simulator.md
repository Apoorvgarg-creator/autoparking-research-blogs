We are starting with a research on autoparking using DRL. First thing, we need to understand is the Simulator for the project. Currently, we found that SMARTS and Carla Simulator are most used once in the area. But SMARTs Simulator is more focussed on the 

SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training Simulator) is a tool designed for training and evaluating autonomous vehicle behavior. This blog walks you through installation, setup, and running your first simulation. Learn about the prerequisites, environment setup, and launching a sample scenario with detailed steps to explore the world of autonomous driving simulations.
