Action space defines the set of possible moves an agent can make. In this blog, we delve into the structure of the action space in SMARTS simulations. Youâ€™ll learn how to customize it for autoparking scenarios, define discrete or continuous actions, and align them with your learning algorithm for optimal performance.
